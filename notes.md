## Future steps:
- Add backtesting html
- Add portfolio performance metrics / summary statistics on the index.html page
- Integrate backtesting into a "portfolio strategy lab" of sorts


## Current problems:
- Add portfolio display
- Add cash and net value to each portfolio display
- Transactions HTML and API
    - Change the lookup API to a public alternative like yfinance
    - Add latest price/quote + general API functionality to transactions html and api


## Learning opportunities:
- Review the load strategies dropdown for default selection
- Know when to use which HTTP request
- Understand await and how asynchronous functions actually work
- Understand how GET links the API to the template via the URL dynamically in AJAX
- Understand the object types in sqlite3 and JS
- Learn how to debug using consol logs, alerts and prints

## Lower priority:
- Learn how to use response checks
- Learn how to use consol.log() and developer tools more broadly
- Be better at server- and client-side validation
