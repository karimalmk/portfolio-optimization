## Future steps:
- Add backtesting html
- Add portfolio performance metrics / summary statistics on the index.html page
- Integrate backtesting into a "portfolio strategy lab" of sorts


## Current problems:
- Whenever you rename and reload the strategies drop-down, you must auto-select the portfolio which was previously selected!


## Learning opportunities:
- Review the load strategies dropdown for default selection
- Know when to use which HTTP request
- Understand the object types in sqlite3 and JS
- Learn how to debug using consol logs, alerts and prints
- Be better at server- and client-side validation
