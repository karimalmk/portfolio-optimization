## Future steps:

- Add backtesting html
- Add portfolio performance metrics / summary statistics on the index.html page
- Integrate backtesting into a "portfolio strategy lab" of sorts

## Current problems:

- Add latest price/quote + cash and net value to each portfolio display
- Complete transactions html page and api's
- Add navigation between home, transactions, and backtesting space
- Change the lookup API to a public alternative like yfinance

## Learning opportunities:

- Review completion of the event handlers for renaming and deletion (so-called "event delegation")
