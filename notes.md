## Future steps:

- Add backtesting html
- Add portfolio performance metrics / summary statistics on the index.html page
- Integrate backtesting into a "portfolio strategy lab" of sorts

## Current problems:

- Include option to delete strategies
- Add latest price/quote + cash and net value to each portfolio display
- Include placeholders for empty portfolios
- Complete transactions index, incorporating state memory (session's strategy_id)
- Add navigation between home, transactions, and backtesting space
- Change the lookup API to a public alternative like yfinance
